# 🧠 Competitive Programming

This repository contains solutions to competitive programming problems, contests, and training exercises. It includes problems from platforms like Beecrowd, Codeforces, HackerRank and VJudge, as well as official ICPC contests and academic training programs.

Most solutions are written in **C++**, leveraging STL and performance-oriented techniques, but you'll also find some problems solved in **Java**, **Python**, and **C**.
